Here's a backup of what it looked like: https://web.archive.org/web/20220127233707/https://link-archive.org/
You can't use that link for searching anymore though.

Update 2024: This project has reached its EOL. Sorry if you were using it (I've been told by a few that were). The server and its data will be gone in a few days. I still have the 67 GB backup mentioned in the link above locally on my hard drive. It's *not* in a replace-and-go format, so you should know what you are doing. Should you need it *for a good reason*, I might send it to you somehow, then please get in contact.

I won't be keeping the actual DB though, because 500 GB (uncompressed) is just a ridiculous amount of storage.
